<p>Hi, I'm Mark. I like to build things, in real life and on the computer. This is my personal site where collect ideas and projects. I built it to be super lightweight and easy to play with.</p>
<p>All pages are written in markdown, and I use a Python script <a href="https://blog.hamaluik.ca/posts/build-your-own-static-site-generator/">(inspiration here)</a> to generate the HTML pages.</p>
