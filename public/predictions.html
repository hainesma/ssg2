<p>I'm writing this in the winter of 2021. </p>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has been the defining event of the past year</p>
<h3>Religion and Spirituality</h3>
<p>Religion in the 20th century was closely tied to group identities. I'm predicting a shift to <em>à la carte</em> religion in the coming years, with individuals adopting whatever elements of belief and practice suit their needs.</p>
<p>Practice, in particular, has left Protestant Christianity. Compare this with Sunni Islam, which entails a physical prayer routine five times a day.</p>
