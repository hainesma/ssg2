### Religion and Spirituality

Religion in the 20th century was closely tied to group identities. I'm predicting a shift to *Ã  la carte* religion in the coming years, with individuals adopting whatever elements of belief and practice suit their needs.

Practice, in particular, has left Protestant Christianity. Compare this with Sunni Islam, which entails a physical prayer routine five times a day.
