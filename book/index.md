# I’m Mark Haines. 

Welcome to my website. It’s a place to document things I’ve been working on and share my insights and ideas.

### Software Portfolio

This website ([See GitHub repo](https://github.com/hainesma/ssg2)) - Designed to be portable and fast, I write the pages in markdown and use a Python script to generate HTML files, which are hosted in an S3 bucket.

[Wellness App](https://github.com/hainesma/ActualProject1) - 
We built this app as our final group project for the Grand Circus bootcamp. It's a C#/.Net app with Angular on the front end. Both the app and database are hosted on Azure.

[Real Estate CRUD App](https://github.com/hainesma/HouseStore) - This is a basic CRUD app with a real estate theme, built in C#/.Net. Both the app and database are hosted on Azure.
