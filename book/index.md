Hi, I'm Mark. I like to build things, in real life and on the computer. This is my personal site where collect ideas and projects. I built it to be super lightweight and easy to play with.

All pages are written in markdown, and I use a Python script [(inspiration here)](https://blog.hamaluik.ca/posts/build-your-own-static-site-generator/) to generate the HTML pages. 

I like building things from scratch. It just doesn't feel right to import a black box of functionality that's beyond my understanding.
