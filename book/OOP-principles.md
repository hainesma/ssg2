# OOP Principles and SOLID Principles

## The Four Pillars of Object-Oriented Programming

### Abstraction

Abstraction refers to hiding unnecessary details from the user and only showing essential features.

### Encapsulation

Encapsulation refers to putting related code into its own class and then restricting access to that class. In C#, access modifiers (`public` or `private`) can control whether a property of an object can be modified by other parts of the program.

### Inheritance

Inheritance refers the passing of data and functionality from a parent class to a child class. This removes redundant code by allowing for subtypes that contain all the properties of the base class.

### Polymorphism

Polymorphism refers to objects of different classes being accessible through the same interface.
