# Adding Google Fonts to a Website

Use Google Fonts to easily add attractive, contemporary fonts to a website.

There's just a few steps to the process:

### Go to fonts.google.com and select font families

Head over to [fonts.google.com](https://fonts.google.com) and find the fonts you want to use. Click on the tile for your desired font. Then click **+ Select this style** for each of the styles you want to use.

### Copy link tags into your HTML file

Click on the button in the top, right corner. It's made of three squares and a plus sign. This is where your font list is kept.

Under the section titled **Use on the web**, copy the `<link>` tags, all three of them. Then go over to the HTML file where you want to use font, and paste the `<link>` tags into the `<head>` of the HTML, where you have the `<title>` and `<meta>` tags.

This makes the font available to the page.

### Copy CSS rules into your CSS file

Back in the **Use on the web** section, beneath the <link> tags, copy the CSS rule for the specific font family that you want to use for a particular class or id.
